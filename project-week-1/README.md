# DD1349 | Week 1
## Continue Planning Your Project!
_Don't forget the pallinda._

Sometimes projects don't turn out as expected. The least you can do is to lay out your expectations. Everyone should be reaching for the same goal with somwhat aligned prioritations.

Since your project doesn't come with specific instructions or a clear picture of what result to produce, you have to reach an understanding within your groups of what to produce. 

**Fact**: Most conflicts are psudoconflicts; conflicts that shouldn't be; conflicts born out of a missunderstanding rather than differing opinions.

## Assignment
### Define your project
Yes! The task this week is only to continue preparing for the project. This is so that you can work on pallinda and the project in parallel while haveing time for both!

Keep on reading to find more detailed descriptions of some of these steps!

1. Define milstones for your project
2. Compile a board/table of _must-haves_, _nice-to-have_ and _risks_.
   - Seperate your project MVP requirements from the "dream" senario.
   - Admit the obvious risks and flaskhalsar. 
3. Entertain a fashionable README file.

See week 0 for project expectations.

## Structure

In project management it's important to differ between business requirements, system requirements and functional reqirements. Business requirements define the value or desired _user experience_ of a product. System requirements define _what_ a product should do. Functional requirements define _how_ a product should do it. Each business requirement can imply multible system requirements, which in turn can imply several functional requirements.

Coffee brewer example:
- B-Req: User should be able to drink freshly brewed coffie without burning their tunge.
- S-Req: The brewer must brew coffie at a temprature no more than 90 degrees.
- F-Req: The water cooking stage is exited when the temerature sensor reach 90 degrees. 

A larger project measure its progress in stories/epics after each business requirement. An epic contains multible milestones with submilestones representing each system requirement. Further, each milestone has several associating issues representing functional requirements.

Treat your short project description as your set of business requirements, your milestones as your system requirements and your issues as functional requirements. Even bug issues belongs to a milestone.
